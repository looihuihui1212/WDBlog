      <h5>HTML</h5>
      <img src="images/HTML_Blog-scaled.jpeg" alt="html" class="img">
      <p>Today I learned about HTML. HTML is my favorite module because I love designing websites, but when it comes to JavaScript, I want to give up. I should have been born during the invention of the internet and be the one using HTML4.Most Websites are created with
        languages called HTML & CSS. By learning these two powerful languages, you will be able to build websites on our own. </p>

      <h5>Getting started with Javascript</h5>
      <p>Today, I learnt the basics of JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language used to make websites interactive. It runs in web browsers and allows us to change the website content dynamically. 
        I learned about variables, which are like boxes to store information and uase js to retrieve data. Additionally, I also learnt about objects, arrays, operations and loops. These are similiar to python. </p>
